## Senior Cubers Worldwide - Weekly Competition

### Short Video Competition

#### Pyraminx, Skewb, Square-1 and Clock

##### Rules

- Entry in one continuous video
- Cube and timer visible
- Inspection limit of 15 seconds
- You can use an "extra" solve if you are interrupted mid-solve (much like per WCA comps)

##### Process

- Use the 5 scrambles provided for Ao5 / Mo3 <sup>[1]</sup> - see cutoffs below
- Post your video directly to the event page or upload to YouTube and share the link
  - Include your age category (e.g. 40+) in the video description
  - Include your times and Ao5 / Mo3 in the video description, written to 2 decimal places
    - Please write times unambiguously; e.g. 9.32 rather than 7.32 + 2
  - Indicate if it is your fastest average to date with a ðŸ”¥ emoji <sup>[2]</sup>
  - Indicate if it is your fastest single to date with a âš¡ emoji <sup>[2]</sup>
- Submit your results via the Google Form <sup>[3]</sup>

##### Cutoffs

- Pyraminx: Everyone should attempt five solves for an Ao5
- Skewb: Everyone should attempt five solves for an Ao5
- Square-1: Requires sub-1:00 (within first 3 solves) to qualify for Ao5, otherwise do Mo3
- Clock: Everyone should attempt five solves for an Ao5

Ao5 = average of 5 (discard fastest and slowest solves), Mo3 = mean of 3
