- Post your video directly to the event page or upload to YouTube and share the link
  - Include your age category (e.g. 40+) in the video description
  - Include your times and Ao5 / Mo3 in the video description, written to 2 decimal places
    - Please write times unambiguously; e.g. 19.32 rather than 17.32 + 2
  - Indicate if it is your fastest average to date with a ðŸ”¥ emoji <sup>[2]</sup>
  - Indicate if it is your fastest single to date with a âš¡ emoji <sup>[2]</sup>
- Submit your results via the Google Form <sup>[3]</sup>

#### Cutoffs

- 3x3x3: Everyone should attempt five solves for an Ao5
- 2x2x2: Everyone should attempt five solves for an Ao5
- One-Handed: Requires sub-45 (within first 3 solves) to qualify for Ao5, otherwise do Mo3
