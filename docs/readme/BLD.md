## Senior Cubers Worldwide - Weekly Competition

### BLD Video Competition

#### 3BLD, 4BLD and 5BLD

##### Rules

- Entry in one continuous video (3BLD). 4BLD and 5BLD can use multiple videos in comments.
- Cube and timer visible, ideally showing you blindfolded as well
- Solve time includes memo and execution
- Best solve wins, unlike the other events which are based on the average
- You can use an "extra" solve if you are interrupted mid-solve (much like per WCA comps)

##### Process

- Use the 3 scrambles provided <sup>[1]</sup> - either 1, 2 or 3 attempts
- Post your video directly to the event page or upload to YouTube and share the link
- Include your age category (e.g. 40+) in the video description
- Include your times and Mo3 in the video description, written to 2 decimal places
- Please write times unambiguously; e.g. 1:19.32 rather than 1:17.32 + 2 and DNF rather than 1:17.32 (DNF)
- Show if it is your fastest average to date with a ðŸ”¥ emoji <sup>[2]</sup>
- Show if it is your fastest single to date with a âš¡ emoji <sup>[2]</sup>
- Submit your results via the Google Form <sup>[3]</sup>

Note: You choose how many attempts but use the scrambles in order
