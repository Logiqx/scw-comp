### Prizes

To encourage wide participation in the competition we are able to offer prizes, kindly provided by [TheCubicle](https://www.thecubicle.com/).

Every week, 4 competitors will be selected at random and will receive a $5 gift card.

The more events you enter the greater your chance of winning!



### How It Works

The events / puzzles are grouped as follows for the prize draw:

- 3x3x3, 2x2x2, One-Handed and Megaminx
- 4x4x4, 5x5x5, 6x6x6 and 7x7x7
- Pyraminx, Skewb, Square-1 and Clock
- 3BLD, 4BLD, 5BLD, FMC ... plus MultiBLD when it is added to the weekly competition

For each competition submission, your name will go into the prize draw, limited to 2 events / puzzles per group.

Due to it being a single prize draw, prizes are not biased towards specific events; all events have an equal chance of winning a prize.

Taking part in multiple events / puzzles will increase your chances of winning a prize.



### Examples

Here are some example to illustrate multiple entries into the prize draw:

- 4x4x4 + 5x5x5 + 6x6x6 + 7x7x7 = 2 entries (1 group, limit is 2 entries)
- 3x3x3 + 2x2x2 + 4x4x4 + 5x5x5 = 4 entries (2 groups, limit is 4 entries)
- 3x3x3 + 2x2x2 + 4x4x4 + 5x5x5 + Pyraminx + Skewb = 6 entries (3 groups, limit is 6 entries)
- 3x3x3 + 2x2x2 + 4x4x4 + 5x5x5 + Pyraminx + Skewb + 3BLD + FMC = 8 entries (4 groups, limit is 8 entries)



### Limits

A single competitor can have a maximum of 8 prize draw entries in a single week; 4 groups x 2 events.

Multiple entries will increase your chance of winning but there is a limit of one prize per competitor per week.

The 4 prizes will be awarded to 4 different people in a single week but everyone is eligible to win again in future weeks.
