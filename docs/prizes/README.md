![TheCubicle](cubicle.png)

**NOTE: Prizes were only awarded to June 2025, after this date we have been unfortunately been unable to award prizes. If you know anyone who would be willing to sponsor us and allow us to resume awarding prized please let us know. The information that follows is for historial purposes only.**

### Prizes

To encourage wide participation in the competition we are able to offer prizes, kindly provided by [TheCubicle](https://www.thecubicle.com/).

Every competition, 4 competitors will be selected at random and will receive a $10 gift card.

The more events you enter the greater your chance of winning!



### How It Works

The events / puzzles are grouped as follows for the prize draw:

- 3x3x3, 2x2x2, One-Handed and Megaminx
- 4x4x4, 5x5x5, 6x6x6 and 7x7x7
- Pyraminx, Skewb, Square-1 and Clock
- 3BLD, 4BLD, 5BLD, MBLD and FMC

For each competition submission, your name will go into the prize draw, limited to 2 events / puzzles per group.

Due to it being a single prize draw, prizes are not biased towards specific events; all events have an equal chance of winning a prize.

Taking part in multiple events / puzzles will increase your chances of winning a prize.



### Examples

Here are some example to illustrate multiple entries into the prize draw:

- 4x4x4 + 5x5x5 + 6x6x6 + 7x7x7 = 2 entries (1 group, limit is 2 entries)
- 3x3x3 + 2x2x2 + 4x4x4 + 5x5x5 = 4 entries (2 groups, limit is 4 entries)
- 3x3x3 + 2x2x2 + 4x4x4 + 5x5x5 + Pyraminx + Skewb = 6 entries (3 groups, limit is 6 entries)
- 3x3x3 + 2x2x2 + 4x4x4 + 5x5x5 + Pyraminx + Skewb + 3BLD + FMC = 8 entries (4 groups, limit is 8 entries)



### Limits

A single competitor can have a maximum of 8 prize draw entries in a single period; 4 groups x 2 events.

Multiple entries will increase your chance of winning but there is a limit of one prize per competitor per period.

The 4 prizes will be awarded to 4 different people in a single period but everyone is eligible to win again in future competitions.
