## Senior Cubers Worldwide - Weekly Competition

### Introduction

This is the weekly video competition for the [Senior Cubers Worldwide](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1604105099735401/?ref=bookmarks) group on Facebook.

The general concept is to use the scrambles provided and to record your solves on camera. The video can be uploaded directly to Facebook or uploaded to YouTube and the link shared on Facebook.

This serves as a good way of practicing for actual WCA competitions where nerves can be a big factor in your results. It allows anyone to ask for critique of their solves, provide encouragement to others and watch faster solvers for inspiration.

To encourage wide participation in the competition we also offer prizes, kindly provided by [TheCubicle](https://www.thecubicle.com/). An explanation of the prize draw system can be found on the [prizes](prizes/README.md) page.

All of the competitions can be found in the group [calendar](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1604105099735401/events/?source=4&action_history=null&filter=calendar) on Facebook.

### FAQ

#### How do I get the permalink?

- On a computer you just click on the time of the post and it opens it via the permalink.
- On an Android phone / tablet you simply click on "..." and use the "copy link" option.
- On an iPhone / iPad you have to save the post. You then have access to "copy link" via the saved post.

#### Why do I need to provide the best and average?

Approximately 5% of the submissions contain typos in the results. Providing the best and average allows my Python script check for typos whilst processing the results. If my Python script detects an anomaly then I refer back to the video post on Facebook and if necessary, check the times in the video.

#### Do I have to provide a video?

The main concept behind this competition is to be able to share our solves with each other, encourage positive feedback / critique, gain inspiration from others and provide a medium through which we can improve. Filming solves is a great way to replicate competition nerves and for anyone who competes (or plans to compete) in WCA competitions it is a useful way of practicing.

Everyone taking part in this competition is in the same boat when filming their solves and although it can be nerve racking, it is very satisfying to capture good solves on camera. If you do not wish to film yourself solving for the weekly competition or if you cannot film there are always the "daily scrambles" and "daily challenges" in the group.

#### My internet connection is slow... what should I do about the video?

If you have a slow internet connection then you can reduce the size of the video by using a tool such as [Handbrake](https://handbrake.fr/).

I did a very quick video about how to use Handbrake and posted it on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1604105099735401/permalink/2168677073278198/).
