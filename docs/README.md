## Senior Cubers Worldwide - Weekly Competition

### Summary

This is the weekly video competition for the [Senior Cubers Worldwide](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1604105099735401/?ref=bookmarks) group on Facebook.

The general concept is to use the scrambles provided and to record your solves on camera. The video can be uploaded directly to Facebook or uploaded to YouTube and the link shared on Facebook.

This serves as a good way of practicing for actual WCA competitions where nerves can be a big factor in your results. It allows anyone to ask for critique of their solves, provide encouragement to others and watch faster solvers for inspiration.

To encourage wide participation in the competition we also offer prizes, kindly provided by [TheCubicle](https://www.thecubicle.com/). An explanation of the prize system can be found on a [separate page](Prizes.md).

All of the competitions can be found in the [group calendar](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1604105099735401/events/?source=4&action_history=null&filter=calendar) on Facebook.

### FAQ

#### How do I get the permalink?

On a computer you just click on the time of the post and it opens it via the permalink.

On Android you simply click ... to get "copy link".

On iOS you have to save the post then can access "copy link" via the saved post.

#### Why do I need to provide the best and average?

Approximately 5% of the submissions contain typos in the results.

Providing the best and average allows my Python script check for typos and correct whilst processing the results.

If my Python script detects an anomaly then I refer to the submission on Facebook and if necessary, check the times in the video.

#### Do I have to provide a video?

The main concept behind this competition is to be able to share our solves with each other, encourage positive feedback / critique and help us to improve. Filming solves is a good way to re-create competition nerves and for those who compete in WCA competitions it is a useful way of practicing for competitions.

Everyone is in the same boat when they film their solves and it is nice to capture good solves by members of the group on film. If you do not wish to film your solves or do not have the facilities to do so then there are "daily scrambles" and "daily challenges" in the group.

#### How can  I speed up the video upload?

If you have a slow internet connection then you can reduce the size of the video by using a tool such as [Handbrake](https://handbrake.fr/).

I did a very quick video about how to use Handbrake and posted it on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1604105099735401/permalink/2168677073278198/).
