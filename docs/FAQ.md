## Senior Cubers Worldwide - Weekly Competition

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### How do I get the video / permalink?

Facebook video:

- On a computer you just click on the video and it opens via the "video" link.
- On an Android phone / tablet you simply click on "..." and use the "copy link" option.
- On an iPhone / iPad you have to save the post. You then have access to "copy link" via the saved post.

YouTube video:

- On a computer you just click on the timestamp of your post and it opens via the "permalink".
- On an Android phone / tablet you simply click on "..." and use the "copy link" option.
- On an iPhone / iPad, I'm not sure... please let me know if you figure it out!

#### Why do I need to provide the best and average?

Approximately 5% of the submissions contain typos in the results. Providing the best and average allows my Python script check for typos whilst processing the results. If my Python script detects an anomaly then I refer back to the video post on Facebook and if necessary, check the times in the video.

#### Why has my average been increased / decreased 0.01?

Some timers do not calculate averages correctly and people calculating them by hand may also make mistakes. Whilst solve times are truncated to two decimal places (e.g. 19.556 is truncated to 19.55), averages should be rounded (e.g. 19.553 becomes 19.55 whereas 19.556 becomes 19.56). The results page for this competition will always show averages based on the correct rounding.

#### Do I have to provide a video?

The main concept behind this competition is to be able to share our solves with each other, encourage positive feedback / critique, gain inspiration from others and provide a medium through which we can improve. Filming solves is a great way to replicate competition nerves and for anyone who competes (or plans to compete) in WCA competitions it is a useful way of practicing.

Everyone taking part in this competition is in the same boat when filming their solves and although it can be nerve racking, it is very satisfying to capture good solves on camera. If you do not wish to film yourself solving for the weekly competition or if you cannot film there are always the "daily scrambles" and "daily challenges" in the group.

#### My internet connection is slow... what should I do about the video?

If you have a slow internet connection then you can reduce the size of the video by using a tool such as [Handbrake](https://handbrake.fr/).

I did a very quick video about how to use Handbrake and posted it on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1604105099735401/permalink/2168677073278198/).

Handbrake is also available for Windows, macOS, Linux and even Android. It does not appear to be available on iOS.
