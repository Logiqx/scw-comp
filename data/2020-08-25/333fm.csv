Adam Robson,<40,,30,https://www.facebook.com/events/599329904283159/permalink/602657533950396,30 moves which Iâ€™m happy with. I have 23 to last 3 corner but only 1 cancellation ðŸ˜­ made it in super quick time though so pretty happy.
Michael George,40+,2015GEOR02,36,https://www.facebook.com/events/599329904283159/permalink/605030907046392,I wasted a lot of time on this and abandoned many early attempts. I didn't have time to search for insertions on my 23 move 3C3E so I went with my 4C3E backup which was solved using COLL.
